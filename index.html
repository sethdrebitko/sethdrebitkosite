      This is primarily my homebase for development news on my Indie Game Dev
      journey, and the tools I'm both developing and finding to help. I'm also
      sharing all my lessons learned along the journey to try and pursue my
      passions in a healthy way while balancing a day job and family.
    </p>

    <h1>Projects</h1>

    <h2>Text World</h2>

    <p>
      This is my first game project I'm working on. I absolutely love the story
      engine (technical term?) underlying the game Rimworld. While I'm still
      learning 2d art I've decided to restrict myself to just creating a
      game using only text.
    </p>

    <p>
      The game is one in which the player takes on the role of a group of
      survivors crash landing on a planet full of crazy cannibals, warlords, and
      monstrosities. In the beginning your colonists will struggle to survive in
      their new harsh environment, but assuming they do you'll need to make the
      decision to either tame this wild land and carve out a portion for
      yourself, or cast your eyes back to the stars.
    </p>

    <h2>Learning 2d Art</h2>

    <p>
      While I don't envision myself becoming a master I'm hoping to acquire at least passable enough skills to get some
      very simple art down.
    </p>

    <h2>Recovery</h2>
    <p>
      Since the start of the pandemic (I'm sure like many others) I've struggled pretty deeply with mental health
      issues, which has also formed a feedback loop with declining physical fitness. While I have made a great deal of
      progress on my mental health I'm still struggling with my physical health. Aside from getting more walking in and
      eating healthier I'm also planning to implement a mobility routine.
