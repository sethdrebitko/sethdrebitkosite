    <p>
      If you're reading this that's pretty cool... Forgive the appearance I'm
      still brushing up on my web technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is primarily my homebase for development news on my Indie Game Dev
      journey, and the tools I'm both developing and finding to help. I'm also
      sharing all my lessons learned along the journey to try and pursue my
      passions in a healthy way while balancing a day job and family.
    </p>

    <h1>Projects</h1>

    <h2>Text World</h2>

    <p>
      This is my first game project I'm working on. I absolutely love the story
      engine (technical term?) underlying the game Rimworld. While I'm still
      learning 3d modeling I've decided to restrict myself to just creating a
      game using only text.
    </p>

    <p>
      The game is one in which the player takes on the role of a group of
      survivors crash landing on a planet full of crazy cannibals, warlords, and
      monstrosities. In the beginning your colonists will struggle to survive in
      their new harsh environment, but assuming they do you'll need to make the
      decision to either tame this wild land and carve out a portion for
      yourself, or cast your eyes back to the stars.
    </p>

    <p>
      I know that I could in theory I could fill a game with pre-generated assets, but that provides two major
      problems,
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        time is taken away from learning 3d modeling to hunt down assets that fit my project
      </li>
      <li>
        assets sourced from a variety of asset packs are not likely to have a cohesive visual style
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Learning 3d Modeling</h2>

    <p>
      While I don't envision myself becoming a master of 3d modeling my hope is that through practice over time I will
      become a somewhat competent low poly 3d modeler. Specifically, my plane is to work in Blender because there are
      honestly just loads more learning resources available learning resources for it compared to other programs.
    </p>

    <h2>This Site</h2>

    <p>
      For my day job I work as a legacy programmer, however ultimately I will be responsible for updating our ancient
      system to something modern. This web app that I am building will not just act as my own little personal
      community/patreon style hub, but also some good real world practice.
    </p>

    <h2>Recovery</h2>
    <p>
      Since the start of the pandemic (I'm sure like many others) I've struggled pretty deeply with mental health
      issues, which has also formed a feedback loop with declining physical fitness. While I have made a great deal of
      progress on my mental health I'm still struggling with my physical health. Aside from getting more walking in and
      eating healthier I'm also planning to implement a mobility routine.
